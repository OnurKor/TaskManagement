# Token Refresh Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a robust token refresh mechanism for the application to ensure uninterrupted user experience when tokens expire.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **Reactive Token Refresh System**
   - Now detects 401 errors and automatically refreshes tokens
   - Queues concurrent requests during token refresh
   - Retries failed requests once a new token is obtained

2. **Simplified Authentication Service**
   - Removed localStorage checks and made token refresh more direct
   - Improved error handling and added better code comments
   - Made refreshSession function more focused by requiring a refresh token parameter

3. **Eliminated Redundancy**
   - Removed authHelper.ts (duplicate functionality)
   - Removed manual token refresh timer in App.tsx
   - Simplified ProtectedRoute.tsx to focus on authentication

4. **Added Testing Tools**
   - Created testTokenRefresh.js utility for testing token refresh
   - Made API and store available globally for testing
   - Added forceTokenExpiration action to userSlice for testing

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Users won't see loading screens when tokens expire
   - No interruptions to user workflow when tokens need refresh

2. **Better Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns between auth service and API configuration
   - Well-commented and maintainable code

3. **More Reliable Authentication**
   - Proper handling of token refresh failures
   - Automatic login redirection when refresh tokens expire

## How to Test

1. Log in to the application
2. Open the browser console
3. Run `testTokenRefresh()` function
4. Observe if the API call succeeds after token refresh

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the token refresh mechanism in production
2. Collect user feedback on the authentication experience
3. Consider implementing a session timeout notification for improved UX
