# Migration Plan for TaskManagement Project

This document outlines the plan for completing the migration to a feature-based folder structure.

## Completed Migration Steps
1. Created new feature-based folder structure
2. Moved key files to their new locations
3. Updated import paths in migrated files
4. Fixed references in ProtectedRoute component

## Pending Cleanup
The following files are now redundant and can be safely removed once we've verified the application is working correctly:

### Old Redux Store (already migrated to /src/store)
- /src/redux/hooks.ts
- /src/redux/store.ts
- /src/redux/slices/userSlice.ts

### Old Utils (already migrated to /src/shared/utils)
- /src/utils/authHelper.ts
- /src/utils/supabaseClient.ts
- /src/utils/axiosConfig.ts

### Old Components (already migrated to feature-specific folders)
- /src/components/LoadingAuth.tsx (moved to /src/shared/components)
- /src/pages/auth/Login.tsx (moved to /src/features/auth/pages)
- /src/pages/auth/Register.tsx (moved to /src/features/auth/pages)

### Old Hooks (already migrated to /src/shared/hooks)
- /src/hooks/useSupaBaseApi.ts

## Cleanup Commands
Once we've verified the application is working correctly, run the following commands to remove redundant files:

```bash
# Remove old Redux files
rm -rf src/redux

# Remove old Utils
rm -rf src/utils

# Remove old Components
rm -rf src/components
rm -rf src/pages

# Remove old Hooks
rm -rf src/hooks
```

## Final Verification
After cleaning up, run the application again to ensure everything still works correctly.
