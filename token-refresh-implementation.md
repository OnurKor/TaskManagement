# Token Refresh Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a robust token refresh mechanism in our Task Management application. The new system ensures users experience uninterrupted service when their access tokens expire.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `authService.ts`
- Simplified the token refresh logic to only handle Supabase session operations
- Made the `refreshSession` function more focused by requiring a refresh token parameter
- Improved error handling and added code comments for better maintainability

### 2. Redesigned `axiosConfig.ts`
- Implemented a request queue system to handle concurrent requests during token refresh
- Set up 401 error detection for automatic token refresh
- Added thorough error handling to prevent app crashes
- Used optional chaining to prevent null reference errors

### 3. Updated `ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- Simplified authentication checks by removing redundant localStorage checks
- Improved the component to work with the new token refresh mechanism

### 4. Streamlined `App.tsx`
- Removed the manual token refresh interval
- Simplified the component to rely on Axios interceptors for token refresh

## Removed Code

The file `authHelper.ts` is now redundant and can be safely removed. Its functionality has been migrated to:
- `authService.ts` - For core authentication functions
- `axiosConfig.ts` - For token refresh logic

## How the Token Refresh Works

1. When any API request fails with a 401 error (unauthorized), the Axios interceptor catches it
2. If token refresh is not already in progress, it will:
   - Get the refresh token from the Redux store
   - Call `refreshSession` to get a new access token
   - Update the Redux store with the new tokens
   - Retry the original request with the new token
   - Process any other requests that were queued during token refresh

3. If multiple requests fail while a token refresh is in progress, they are queued and processed once the new token is obtained

4. If token refresh fails, the user is logged out and redirected to the login page

## Testing the Implementation

To verify the token refresh mechanism works correctly:

1. Log in to the application
2. Wait for the access token to expire (or you can force expiration by modifying the token)
3. Make an API request
4. The request should succeed after the token is automatically refreshed
5. No loading screen should appear during this process

## Cleanup Tasks

1. Delete the redundant `authHelper.ts` file
2. Remove any remaining references to `authHelper.ts` in the codebase

## Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Improved User Experience**: No interruptions when tokens expire
2. **Better Error Handling**: Proper management of failed requests and token refresh
3. **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns between auth service and API configuration
4. **Reliability**: Robust queue management for multiple concurrent requests
5. **Maintainability**: Well-commented code and simpler architecture
